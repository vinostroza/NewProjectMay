        <p style="text-align:center">"Family defined as the co-residence and the organization by kinship are both
            integral in the development of the concept of the family. A co-residential group that makes up a household
            may share general survival goals and a residence, but may not fulfill the varied and sometimes ambiguous
            requirements for the definition of a family."</p>

        <br>
        <p>The traditional family structure in the United States is considered a family support system involving two
            married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent,
            nuclear family has become less prevalent, and alternative family forms have become more common. The family
            is created at birth and establishes ties across generations. Those generations, the extended family of
            aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear
            family.
            Over time, the transtructure has had to adapt to very influential changes, including divorce and the
            introduction of single-parent families, teenage pregnancy and unwed mothers, and same-sex marriage, and
            increased interest in adoption. Social movements such as the feminist movement and the stay-at-home father
            have contributed to the creation of alternative family forms, generating new versions of the American
            family.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Families</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Nuclear families, also known as elementary or traditional families, consist of two parents (usually
                married or common law) and their children. Nuclear families may have one or more children who are
                biological or adopted, but the main idea is that the parents are raising their kids together in the
                family home.
                Even though nuclear families seem to be on the decline, 2016 U.S. Census data shows that 69% of children
                still live in nuclear families. Even though it doesn't always work out that way, to most people this is
                the ideal family environment to raise children in.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Nuclear families can be strong and successful, with both parents being great examples for their kids.
                These kids often have many advantages over other families with less, which can help them get ahead in
                life. However, like any family, nuclear families have their struggles to face. For example, if parents
                shut out grandparents and other extended family, chances are their support system will not be strong and
                getting through hard times can be challenging.</p>

            <h2>Single Parent</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Single parent families consist of one parent with one or more kids. In these cases, the parent either
                never married, is widowed, or divorced. A paper by Ellwood, D.T., and Jencks, C. (2004) talks about how
                single-parent families have been on the rise since the 1960s when divorce rates started going up (and so
                did births happening out of wedlock). They suggest that these changes could be due to many different
                factors, from changing morals in society to increasing arguments over gender roles.

            <p>Being a single parent raising kids can be hard. It can also be hard being a kid when your parents are
                split up or if you grew up only knowing one parent. In this situation, families need to make the best of
                what they have and rely on each other for love and support.</p>

            <h2>Extended Family</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>While most people in the U.S. would identify nuclear families as being the 'traditional' family type, in
                different cultures extended families are much more common and have been around for hundreds of years.
                Extended families are families with two or more adults who are related through blood or marriage,
                usually along with children.</p>

            <h2>Childless Family</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Childless families are families with two parents who cannot have or don't want kids. In the world of
                family types and dynamics, these families are often forgotten or left out (even though you can still
                have a family without children). In the past, growing up, getting married, and having children was the
                norm, but in today's world, more people are choosing to postpone having children or deciding not to have
                any.</p>
